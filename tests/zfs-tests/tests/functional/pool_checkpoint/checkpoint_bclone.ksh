# DESCRIPTION:
#	Blocks that a checkpoint references must not be reused while the
#	checkpoint exists, even when they are freed through a block clone
#	(openzfs/zfs#19225).
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create a small pool with block cloning and write a file.
#	2. Take a checkpoint.
#	3. Clone the file, then remove the original and, in a later txg, the
#	   clone.  The clone's block pointer is born after the checkpoint,
#	   but its blocks were allocated before it.
#	4. Fill the pool, so any space that was wrongly freed is reused.
#	5. Rewind to the checkpoint.  The file must read back intact and a
#	   scrub must find no errors.
