# DESCRIPTION:
#	While a raidz expansion that adds several disks at once is in
#	progress, the part of the vdev which has not been reflowed yet still
#	uses the layout from before the expansion, which is several disks
#	narrower, not one.  Replacing a raidz child with a device that is too
#	small for that layout must be refused, both before and after the
#	pool is re-imported with the expansion paused.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	For each parity:
#	1. Create a raidz pool and write some data to it
#	2. Pause the reflow and attach three new devices to the raidz vdev
#	   in one expansion
#	3. Verify that replacing a child with a too small device fails
#	4. Export and import the pool, verify the replacement still fails
#	5. Replace a child with a device of the same size and wait for it
#	6. Let the expansion complete and verify the pool with a scrub
#

typeset -r added=3
typeset -r dev_size_mb=256
#
# Each child of a raidz vdev expanded from W to W+3 children must provide
# at least 1/W of the vdev's allocatable space until the reflow completes.
# For 256M children and parity 1 to 3 (W = 3 to 5) this is more than
# 240M, while 1/(W+2), one disk narrower than the expanded vdev, is less
# than 180M.
