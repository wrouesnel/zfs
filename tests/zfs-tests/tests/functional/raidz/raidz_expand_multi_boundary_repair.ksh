# DESCRIPTION:
#	During a raidz expansion that adds several disks at once, a block
#	that straddles the reflow offset has rows at their new location and
#	rows still at their old one, which is as many disks wide as the vdev
#	was before the expansion, not one disk narrower than it is now.
#	Damage from as many failed disks as there is parity must remain
#	repairable in such a block, also when the reflow has copied some of
#	the damage to the new location.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	For each case (parity, old width, disks added, damaged old disks):
#	1. Create a raidz pool of that parity and width with large
#	   metaslabs, so that the file is written in one piece, write a file
#	   of 1M blocks and attach the new disks in one expansion with the
#	   reflow paused early on.
#	2. Export the pool and zero the part of the damaged old disks that
#	   holds the data the reflow has not copied yet.
#	3. Import the pool and let the reflow copy some more of the data, in
#	   chunks that are not a multiple of the block size so that it can
#	   stop inside a block.  It copies the damage along, spread over all
#	   disks.
#	4. Verify that a block of the file straddles the new reflow offset,
#	   with at least three rows on either side, its first part copied
#	   from the damaged area and its columns on the zeroed disks holding
#	   data (if none does, let the reflow copy a little more and look
#	   again, until one does or the reflow is done; then start the case
#	   again on a new pool, up to five times).  Every row of that block
#	   has a damaged sector per zeroed disk, on that disk in the rows at
#	   the old location and wherever the reflow put it in the others.
#	5. Scrub with the reflow paused.  Verify that it found no data
#	   errors, repaired something and that the file is intact.
#	6. Let the expansion finish, scrub again and verify that it repairs
#	   nothing.
