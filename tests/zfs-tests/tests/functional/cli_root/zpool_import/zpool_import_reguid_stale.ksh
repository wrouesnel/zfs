#
# DESCRIPTION:
# After 'zpool reguid', a stale copy of one of the pool's devices (same
# vdev guid, old pool guid) must be listed and imported as the old pool,
# not matched to the new pool's device (openzfs/zfs#16989).
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a pool on a file vdev, export it and copy the file aside.
# 2. Import the pool, reguid it, write a marker, export it.
# 3. Put the copy next to the original.
# 4. 'zpool import -d' must list two pools with different ids, each on
#    its own device.
# 5. Importing the old id must give the old pool, with the old marker.
