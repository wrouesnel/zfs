#
# DESCRIPTION:
# A writable 'zpool import -T <txg>' must claim the ZIL that was live at that
# txg relative to that txg, even though newer uberblocks are still on disk.
#
# STRATEGY:
# 1. Create a pool and run a synchronous writer, so the ZIL is never empty.
# 2. Note a synced txg while it runs, let two more txgs sync, stop the
#    writer and export.
# 3. Import the pool read-write at the noted txg.
# 4. Export and import it again, and check it with a scrub and zdb.
