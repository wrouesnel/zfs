# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify spa deadman detects a hung txg
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Reduce the zfs_deadman_synctime_ms to 5s.
#	2. Reduce the zfs_deadman_checktime_ms to 1s.
#	3. Inject a 10s zio delay to force long IOs.
#	4. Write enough data to force a long txg sync time due to the delay.
#	5. Keep the delay in place, so the txg stays hung, until at least 3
#	   "deadman" events for the pool have been posted.
#	6. Clear the delay and verify the txg completes and the pool is healthy.

# While the delay is in place every write the txg sync issues takes 10s, so
# the txg stays hung for as long as we wait.  Its sync starts within 5s
# (zfs_txg_timeout); from 5s into the sync the deadman checks it every second
# and posts an event when a write has been outstanding for more than 5s.  The
# events are rate limited to zfs_deadman_events_per_second (1), and two checks
# are often a little less than a second apart, so the rate limiter drops some
# of them, and a stalled VM misses checks.  A fixed sleep would count a
# varying number of events, so wait for at least 3 instead, for up to 120s.
